  <h2>About the Event</h2>
  <p>
    Join Ācārya Sthaneshwar for a FREE 22-Week Course exploring the philosophy and practice of Classical Yoga.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Yogasūtra of Patañjali</strong> is one of the most ancient and foundational texts of Yoga Darśana,
    containing a systematic presentation of India’s Central Philosophy of Meditation. Ācārya Sthaneshwar was taught
    this and other Yoga texts by his Guru, the Kashmiri Saint Paramahaṃsa Svāmī Śrī Saccidānanda Sarasvatī (Khaptaḍ Baba), 
    at his Himalayan hermitage in the mountains of Nepal. He will draw upon this experiential transmission of traditional
    wisdom and classical knowledge to expound the philosophy and practice enshrined in the Yogasūtra of Ṛṣi Patañjali.
  </p>
  <p>
    This course will consist of 18 Lectures and 4 Discussion Sessions on Zoom, Sundays beginning October 5th, 2025 at 11:00 AM EST.  
    There will be no classes scheduled from Mid-December to Mid-January for Winter Break.  
  </p>

<section id="history">
  <h2>History of the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali</h2>
  <p>
    The <em>Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali</em>, composed around the 2nd century BCE, are among the most authoritative 
    and influential texts of the yoga tradition. Widely regarded as the foundation of <strong>classical yoga philosophy</strong>, 
    the work condenses centuries of oral teachings into a clear and systematic guide. 
    It is divided into four chapters (<em>pāda</em>) that cover theory, practice, spiritual powers, and ultimate liberation. 
  </p>
  <p>
    At the heart of the text lies the eight-limbed path (<em>aṣṭāṅga yoga</em>), outlining ethical principles, meditation practices, 
    and states of higher awareness. This framework has shaped not only Indian spiritual traditions but also modern global 
    approaches to yoga, mindfulness, and meditation.
  </p>
  <p>
    For centuries, the <em>Yoga Sūtras</em> have been studied by yogis, philosophers, and seekers worldwide. 
    They integrate metaphysics, psychology, and practical methods into a unified vision of self-realization. 
    Today, they continue to serve as a cornerstone for both traditional practice and contemporary explorations of yoga philosophy.
